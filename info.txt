Here's a WebSocket example using Python with FastAPI and WebSockets. This example demonstrates how to set up a WebSocket server 
using FastAPI and a WebSocket client in Python.

*STEPS*
1. Install Dependencies - Install FastAPI and WebSockets

2. WebSocket Server (FastAPI) - Create a WebSocket server using FastAPI that listens for incoming messages and responds to clients in real time.
    - How it works:
        - Starts a FastAPI WebSocket server on ws://localhost:8000/ws.
        - Accepts WebSocket connections.
        - Listens for messages and sends responses back to the client.

3. WebSocket Client (Python)
    - Now let's create a Python WebSocket client to send and receive messages. (client.py)
    - How it works:
        - Connects to ws://localhost:8000/ws
        - Sends messages typed by the user.
        - Receives and pritns responses from the server.

4. Running the Application
    - Start the WebSocket server: python server.py
    - Run the WebSocket client: python client.py
    - Interact with the WebSocket server:
        - Type a message in the client
        - The server receives it and responds
        - The client displays the server's response


*NEXT STEPS*
1. Deploy the WebSocket server using Docker or on AWS.
2. Integrate with a frontend (React, Next.js)
3. Handle multiple clients using a WebSocket manager
